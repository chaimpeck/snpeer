Peer into your 23andme SNPs


## Why?

I downloaded my 23andme raw data and was clicking on interesting things on snpedia.com and searching in the raw text. I wanted a faster way to join the data with its summaries. While there are services that will do this, I did not want to upload my personal data. So, I made this small python script to join the data and put into a tab-delimitted format, after which I made an html page to display it as a table, with an option to filter only on matches.

## How?

Step 1: Generate the report!
(This will take a long time, but you can open a new terminal window and do Step 2 right away and refresh the page periodically as new data comes in.)

...

Step 2: Host and view the report!

## Disclaimer

If you have downloaded your 23andme raw data, you have probably already read disclaimers about possible inaccuries and that you should not use this information to make any sort of medical decisions. I want to reiterate that here. This is purely intended for getting a more useful view of your 23andme raw data, for the purpose of personal interest. Please keep this in mind and do not panic if you have results that are considered "Bad". Similarly, do no consider yourself invincible if you have results that are considered "Good". Be greatful for who you are and to have this oppurtunity to peer into your single nucleotide polymorphisms!
